It's the fourth Ruby Project In Odin Project And The First Using OOP.

It's made in single comment because I already had the code from another course that I ended giving up because It's not
updated.

You can play by typing the row and the col when it asks you like this 1,1, 0,1, and so goes on.

Enjoy!
